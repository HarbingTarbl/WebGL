CAP4720 Assignment 1: Clock

meshData.js is the same model that you gave us, just changed to conform to the json standards so it can be loaded as a json file.

convert.py is a simple script that converts this json file into the .model and .modeldata format that I use for rendering.

SquareClock.model and SquareClock.modeldata is generated by a program I wrote (https://github.com/HarbingTarbl/WebGLJSONExport/tree/ActualJSON) that can convert most models from the major 3d formats into my format.

The actual clock model is from: http://www.turbosquid.com/3d-models/free-lines-clock-3d-model/644411 and uses a royalty free license that applies to all uses. 

This should work in Safari, Chrome and Firefox. No bets on IE.
If you end up getting errors from the ajax make sure that local file access is allowed. In Safari this can be enabled from the "Developer" dropdown window. For Chrome you must quit any existing chrome windows and then run chrome with the --allow-file-access-from-files argument.
